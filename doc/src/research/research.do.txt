===== Background =====

Morten is a computational physicist whose research spans quantum
many-body theory, computational science, quantum computing, and
machine learning. He has devoted his career to developing and applying
advanced computational methodologies for tackling some of the most
challenging problems in modern physics, with a particular emphasis on
the quantum mechanics of interacting particles.

Morten’s work centers on the idea that computation is a fundamental
theoretical tool, on equal footing with analysis and experiment. He
has made many contributions to the development of state-of-the-art
numerical algorithms, including large-scale many-body methods, quantum
Monte Carlo techniques, and machine-learning–enhanced computational
frameworks. His research connects nuclear physics, condensed matter
theory, quantum chemistry, and quantum information science, providing
unified computational approaches across these traditionally separate
fields.

He has also been deeply involved in the rapidly developing interface
between quantum technologies and machine learning, contributing to the
advancement of quantum algorithms, quantum state engineering, and
hybrid quantum–classical computational strategies. His work extends
from fundamental theoretical problems—such as emergent phenomena and
entanglement in strongly correlated systems—to practical algorithmic
development for simulation platforms and quantum devices.

In addition to his research contributions, Morten is an active
educator and mentor, known for promoting and firmly advocating open
science and open access to computational resources, developing widely
used teaching materials, and contributing to community-building
efforts in computational and quantum science. All course material
developed by Morten is openly available from his GitHub address. Feel
free to download codes and teaching material of interest. And don't
hesitate to use the material wherever you are located.
